# FAQ:

## Q: How do I change my branch?

### A: For VSCode, Click on the bottom left icon with the three connected dots, and choose your team name branch. For GitHub, Click the dropdown menu and choose your team name branch.

## Q: How do I commit? It won't let me!

### A: I've disabled automatic commits for the main branch to avoid problems with team's code. First, Change to your team name branch first, with instructions above, then choose Source Control (third down on the left) and click the Commit dropdown, and choose "Commit and Sync".

## Q: Can I commit changes to other teams code?

### A: I mean if you want to yeah just tell the team beforehand what you are changing and why you're changing it (eg: speed or efficiency, Changing coding style is not a valid reason unless the team has approved it).

## Q: Why don't you just stop people from commiting to other peoples branches?

### A: Because I ain't paying money for that lol.
