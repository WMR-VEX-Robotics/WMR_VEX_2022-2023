# 404 Name Not Found Code

## Why is this here?
This is the code for the Senior Team. It will hopefully work, and if it does, this will act as the documentation for it.

## How does it work?
This is programmed in C++, if you don't know C++, have fun. For those who don't know the game this year is Spin Up, i.e: Frisbee Golf. The robot for this team uses an altered tank drive; the wheels act as though it's a tank drive, but the steering is controlled by a forward axis and a turning axis, as opposed to two forward axes. The rest of the rbot is still being worked on, so expect more updates in the future.
