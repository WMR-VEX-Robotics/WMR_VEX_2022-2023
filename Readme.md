# 404 Name Not Found Code

### Why is this here?
This is the code for the Senior Team. It will hopefully work, and if it does, I won't have to deal wth it. Anyways, this can act as the documentation for it, but is it good, not in the slightest. But hey, this code made it to State's, somehow.

# How does it work?
This is programmed in C++, if you don't know C++, have fun. For those who don't know the game this year is Spin Up, i.e: Frisbee Golf. Also, we have pneumatics,the documentation for them is non-existant, so this code will be your documentation.

## Driver Control
The robot for this team uses an altered tank drive; the wheels act as though it's a tank drive, but the steering is controlled by a forward axis and a turning axis, as opposed to two forward axes. The rest of the driver controll is mainly just assigning buttons for differnt fucntions, nothing special.

## Autonomus
The auton this year has a GUI for selction, bad off of posiion, skill run, etc. There is also odometry, which, according to wikipedia is, "is the use of data from motion sensors to estimate change in position over time". So, if we ever need to do that again, just look here. But, there isn't anythng else worh mentioning outside of game-specific function, but this is here for your perusing.
